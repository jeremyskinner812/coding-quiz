# <Coding-Quiz>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create an interactive quiz to help study some javascript concepts. It was also a way for me to practice my javascript functions and manipulating the DOM. It helps to solve the problem of making studying more fun with the added challenge of a timer and to be able to compete for the highest score. I learned a lot about how to create elements that users can interact with on a page using javascript.

Your timer will begin at 60 seconds counting down by 1 and you select your answers by clicking the green button with your answer choice. A prompt will appear letting you know if you got the answer correct or not and you will need to click ok before answering the next question. A wrong answer will deduct 10 seconds from your remaining time.
